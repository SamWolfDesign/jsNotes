let a = 2;

    let    b    =    1;
//* (1)  (2)   (3)  (4) 

//* 1- Keyword
//* 2- Variable name
//* 3- Assignment Operator
//* 4- Variable Value

console.log(a + b);

let c = 3;
//* PLEASE NOTE JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE
let hello = 'greet'
let Hello = 'greet again'
//* NO SPACES IN VARIABLE NAMES
//* Good time to try camel casing!!

let hiThere = 'hey';
//* Note semi-colon not necessary for JS. Good to do for practice though!

//* VAR LET CONST
var x = 1;
let y = 2;
const z = 3;

//* Declarations vs Initialization
//* Declarations anything to the LEFT 
let n;
console.log(n);
//* Running does "undefinted since nothing defined"
n =10;
console.log(n);
//* No Undefined since variable set for 10


//* LET VS CONST
let today = 'Great!';
const elevenFifty = 'Wonderful!';
console.log(today, elevenFifty);

today = 'Lovely!';
console.log(today, elevenFifty);

// elevenFifty = 'Super!';
// console.log(today, elevenFifty);
// //* elevenFifty not able to be re-assign because used CONST earlier

//* Initialisation name, equal sign, whatever value is
